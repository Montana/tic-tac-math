# Tic Tac – Mach Number and Pressure Ratio Analysis

This script performs a basic aerodynamic analysis of the so-called "Tic Tac" UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon) observed by Cmdr. David Fravor of the U.S. Navy in 2004.

- The speed of sound at high-altitude conditions (~223K)
- Mach numbers for two hypothetical speeds (700 mph and 1500 mph)
- The static-to-stagnation pressure ratio, assuming isentropic flow

These calculations aim to quantify part of the physics associated with the flight characteristics of the Tic Tac object as described by Fravor and confirmed in infrared footage released by the Department of Defense.
